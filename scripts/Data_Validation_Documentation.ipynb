    "##### Correct Column Names\n",

    "Anomalous values checks were applied to identify values outside typical clinical ranges. For certain columns, such as slope and serum_cholesterol, raise_warning=True was used to flag unusual values without stopping execution. Extreme values were handled through imputation or scaling rather than removing them.\n",
